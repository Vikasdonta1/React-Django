# Bookshelf App
The app that helps you track the books you have and haven't finished.

![Preview of the app](preview.png "Preview")

The front-end is built with React and React-Bootstrap, while the back-end is built with
Django Rest Framework.

This mono-repository is developed along with the tutorial series I wrote
"How to Build a Bookshelf App with Django and React".
